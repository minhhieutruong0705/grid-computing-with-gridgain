# GridGain - Ignite - Apply Method
# Distribute a big task to nodes - similar subtasks

## Description
- By making a specific group of nodes together count the characters of a long string, the example illustrates the process that a big task is divided and executed by nodes of a grid system
- This is usually used for computation of a big task which reuqires a system with high/ultra-high performance (high resources comsumption, high computing power)
- Each node does the similar sub-tasks
