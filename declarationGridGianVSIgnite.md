# GridGain and Ignite

## Ignite
GridGain is the enterprise version of Apache Ignite.

Apache Ignite is a memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale. Ignite was open-sourced by GridGain Systems in late 2014 and accepted in the Apache Incubator program that same year.

## GridGain
GridGain is a middleware-class product developed by the company of the same name.

As a middleware, GridGain is an in-memory computing platform that is designed to tackle speed and scale challenges. But what does that mean? In practice, it signifies that GridGain is capable of storing and processing your data right in RAM across a cluster of interconnected machines. GridGain APIs are developed in a way to minimize network traffic between cluster nodes and your applications.
