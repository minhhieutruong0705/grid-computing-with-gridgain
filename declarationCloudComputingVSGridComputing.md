# Cloud Computing and Grid Computing

## Cloud Computing
A Cloud computing refers to a client-server computing framework where resources are managed in centralised fashion. It is provided as a pay per use service. Cloud computing makes the system all time accessible.

## Grid Computing
Grid computing refers to a network of same or different types of computers whose target is to provide a environment where a task can be performed by multiple computers together on need basis. Each computer can work independently as well. Grid Computing is used internally by organization.

## Comparation 

No | Key | Cloud Computing | Grid Computing
-- | --- | --------------- | --------------
1 | Architecture | client-server computing architecture | distributed computing architecture
2 | Resource | centrally managed | managed on collaboration pattern
3 | Flexibility | more flexible | less flexible
4 | Payment | Users pay for using the cloud computing resources. They need not to set up anything. They use platform as a service. | Grid computing needs to be set-up first. User need not to pay anything once set-up is done.
5 | Accessibility | highly accessible | low on accessibility

- Further declaration of flexibility and accessibility
  - Grid computing is better suited for organizations with large amounts of data being requested by a small number of users (or few but large allocation requests), whereas cloud computing is better suited to environments where there are a large number of users requesting small amounts of data (or many but small allocation of requests)
